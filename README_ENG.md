#### Problem Description

The goal of this analysis is to verify a popular and frequently repeated narrative suggesting that the U.S. stock market is currently “historically expensive” and therefore offers poor long-term return prospects. Headlines pointing to “extreme valuations,” “record-high P/E ratios,” or an “inevitable crash” are common, but they often rely on simplified comparisons that ignore structural changes in the economy and in the composition of the S&P 500.

This study places today’s valuation metrics in a broader historical and structural context, using nearly 100 years of data to examine how valuation ratios have behaved over different market regimes and economic environments.

The analysis focuses on:
- the **P/E ratio of the S&P 500** over a long historical horizon,
- the **P/S ratio** and its evolution in a modern, margin-driven economy,
- **sales growth** and forward revenue expectations,
- and the relationship between **valuation metrics and future long-term returns**.

#### Summary and Key Takeaways — What Does This Mean for Investors?

An in-depth analysis of nearly a century of market data shows that many simplified and alarmist narratives circulating online — especially those warning of “bubbles,” “historically high P/E ratios,” or an “imminent crash” — do not hold up when examined in proper historical and structural context. The market, the economy, and the nature of dominant companies have changed too significantly for mechanical comparisons with data from 50 or 70 years ago to be reliable.

#### Three Key Conclusions

##### 1. Today’s “high P/E” does not mean the same thing it did decades ago

A high P/E ratio in 2025 is fundamentally different from a high P/E in 1999, or in the 1960s or 1980s. Since the 1980s, the S&P 500 has gradually shifted toward technology and service-oriented companies — businesses with higher margins, faster growth, superior scalability, and lower capital intensity.

This structural shift naturally increases the “normal” level of P/E, which is supported by:
- a clear upward shift in the median P/E after 2000,
- the absence of a negative correlation between P/E levels and future returns during 2010–2025,
- and the fact that over the past 15 years, high P/E levels were **not** punished by lower long-term returns.

##### 2. The P/S ratio is historically high — but often misinterpreted

The P/S ratio rises primarily when stock prices grow faster than revenues, which is typical in an index dominated by highly scalable, high-margin businesses (especially Big Tech).

Importantly, the P/S ratio:
- says nothing about profitability,
- ignores operating leverage and margin expansion,
- is naturally higher for technology-driven business models.

A high P/S ratio therefore reflects elevated expectations for future growth rather than automatically signaling a speculative bubble.

##### 3. High valuations did not historically imply low future returns (PEG perspective)

Data from 2002–2025 shows that:
- negative 5-year returns were concentrated mostly at **low PEG levels (0–2)**, particularly just before the Global Financial Crisis — when systemic risk was underpriced,
- high PEG values did **not** precede weak long-term performance and often coincided with strong 5- and 10-year returns,
- the strongest long-term historical returns were generated by investments made at **PEG levels between 6 and 8**.

This does not mean that “high PEG is good,” but rather that during periods of strong structural trends (such as digitalization or AI), traditional definitions of “cheap” and “expensive” often stop working as intended.

---

#### Final Thoughts

Today’s elevated valuation metrics are not a clear signal of a market bubble. Instead, they reflect a structurally different economy and a fundamentally different composition of the S&P 500 than in previous decades.

Drawing conclusions based solely on simplistic historical comparisons of P/E, P/S, or PEG ratios can easily lead to incorrect investment decisions. For investors who focus on:
- a long-term horizon,
- a systematic approach,
- and an understanding of structural economic changes,

historical data does **not** support the claim that current valuation levels should trigger panic or an exit from the market.

The market may be valued highly — but that does not necessarily mean it is “expensive.”
